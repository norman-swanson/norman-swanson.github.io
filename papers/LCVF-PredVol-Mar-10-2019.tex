\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Accurate volatility estimation and prediction is crucial to successful risk management and asset allocation. In light of this fact, it is not surprising that the seminal contribution of \cite{Jacod:2018JFE}, originally published as a 1994 working paper, has spurred the development of a veritable arsenal of realized integrated volatility (IV) estimators. A very few of these include realized variance (RV) (\cite{abdl2001}), jump robust RV based on multi-power variation and truncation (\cite{barndorff2004power}, \cite{mancini2009non}, \cite{corsi2010threshold}, \cite{podolskij2010new}), and microstructure noise robust RV based on multi-scale variation and pre-averaging (\cite{jacod2009microstructure} and \cite{ait2011ultra}). One important use of these sorts of IV estimators is in heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) type forecasting models, as introduced in \cite{corsi2009simple}, and built on by \cite{andersen2007roughing}, \cite{corsi2010threshold}, \cite{duong2015empirical}, and \cite{patton2015good}, who augment the basic HAR model by the inclusion of a variety of jump variation related variables.\footnote[1]{More recently, \cite{audrino2016volatility} explore the importance of leverage and downside risk in an HAR forecasting framework, and \cite{bollerslev2016exploiting} further improve volatility forecasting by allowing HAR type model coefficients to evolve according to the degree of measurement error. Overall, there is a very deep and rich literature using HAR models for forecasting, and many key papers are cited in the above references. Other volatility forecasting models that are widely used in the financial econometrics literature include stochastic volatility (SV) models (see e.g., \cite{meddahi2001eigenfunction}, \cite{andersen2004analytical}, \cite{andersen2011realized}), (G)ARCH-type models (see e.g., \cite{andersen2003modeling}, \cite{hansen2005forecast}, \cite{brandt2006volatility}), and Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) models (see e.g., \cite{ghysels2006predicting}, \cite{ghysels2011volatility}).} Although very parsimonious, the HAR-type models analyzed in the above papers only assess whether information derived from the target asset is useful for IV prediction. A less explored question is whether there are useful sources of information other than the target asset itself. 

In this paper, we undertake to answer the above question by proposing and analyzing a shrinkage based methodology for extracting potentially useful predictive information from a large dimensional and high-frequency asset returns dataset. The methodology that we develop hinges on the construction of latent firm, sector, and industry level IV factors, which are used to augment standard HAR prediction models. The procedure that we propose in order to accomplish this is a two-step ``double shrinkage'' procedure. In the first step, we apply either LASSO or elastic net shrinkage on estimated integrated volatilities, in order to select a subset of assets that are informative about our target asset. In the second step, we apply either principal component analysis (PCA) or sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) on the selected assets, in order to estimate a latent return factor. This new factor is in turn utilized to construct a latent IV factor. It is important to note that in the case where the second step involves using SPCA, we are essentially performing double shrinkage. In a first step we shrink the set of IV estimators, in order to ``pare down'' our original dataset. In the second step, we shrink the set of asset returns selected in the first step. One can immediately see that our second step indeed involves shrinkage by noting, as discussed in \cite{zou2006sparse}, that SPCA can be interpreted as a variant of PCA, where the regression coefficients associated with interpreting PCA as a penalized regression problem are ``shrunk'' by imposing LASSO or elastic net constraints on them.\footnote[2]{PCA has been extensively studied in the literature (see e.g., \cite{stock2002forecasting, stock2002macroeconomic, stock2006forecasting}, \cite{bai2006confidence, bai2006evaluating, bai2008forecasting}, and the references cited therein). Additionally, the importance of targeting when using PCA and related dimension reduction methods in forecasting is discussed in \cite{bai2008forecasting}, \cite{cs2016}, \cite{swanson2018big}, and the references cited therein.}
It is in this sense that our procedure involves ``double shrinkage''. Additionally, it is worth pointing out that the first step of our approach builds on methods developed in \cite{bai2008forecasting} in which \textquotedblleft targeted predictors\textquotedblright{} are selected before the estimation of common factors; while the second step builds on the recent generalization of PCA to high-frequency data by \cite{ait2017using, ait2018principal}.

Interestingly, various alternative approaches to the construction of latent IV factors for inclusion in HAR forecasting models yield inferior results to those found using our procedure. In particular, one might imagine that a simpler procedure in which IV factors are directly constructed via PCA or SPCA on firm specific IV estimators will yield comparable predictions to ours. One might also surmise that using IV estimators constructed directly from S\&P500 returns, or from sector specific return indices, or both, will yield comparable predictions. Finally, one might argue that simple HAR models utilizing only ``own-asset'' information will yield comparable predictions. This is not the case, however. Instead, our double shrinkage procedure yields significantly more accurate predictions than all of the above benchmark models. The reason for this finding appears to rest to a great extent on the importance of shrinkage. Namely, by first shrinking on IV in order to select a subset of ``information rich'' assets for use in our procedure, we are avoiding substantial information loss due to data noisiness and multicollinearity across asset returns and IVs. 

Our empirical analysis points to a number of interesting findings. First, we show that for virtually all target assets (at firm, sector and market levels), except for the financial sector, gains associated with using our latent IV factors in HAR model prediction range from approximately 20\% to 45\%, compared with the best performing benchmark models, when comparing \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values.\footnote[3]{Our benchmark models include a variety of alternative specifications, including the models discussed in the previous paragraph.} These findings are robust to the use of different data frequencies (2.5-, 5-, and 10-minute), and hold over the daily forecasting sample period from June 1, 2009--December 31, 2010. Additionally, predictive accuracy tests comparing mean square forecast errors (MSFEs) indicate that \textit{out-of-sample} predictive improvements are statistically significant. Second, we find that implementing our procedure using SPCA in the second step yields prediction models that dominate those associated with the use of PCA. For instance, when comparing predictions of Chevron IV using factors constructed using 2.5- and 5-minute frequency data, factor-augmented models with SPCA have 13\%--18\% larger \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values than those associated with the use of PCA.\footnote[4]{Similar findings characterize all of the firms and sectors examined in the sequel.} The difference is even larger when predicting IV using 10-minute frequency data, although predictions for this frequency are worse, overall, than when predicting using higher frequency data. Taken together, these two findings underscore the importance of shrinkage in volatility prediction, particularly given that SPCA can be equated with the application of PCA (dimension reduction), followed by either LASSO or elastic net shrinkage on the weights estimated in the PCA step, as discussed above.  	

The prediction experiments that we conduct in the sequel also shed light on several other issues. For instance, we find that \textit{in-sample} fit does not improve when our two-step procedure is used to extract IV factors, as compared with simpler benchmark modeling approaches, such as those discussed above. Hence, \textit{in-sample} fit is not improved when IV factors are included in prediction models. Instead benefits accrue only when constructing ex ante predictions. We also find that the ``best'' IV predictions are associated with the use of a 5-minute sampling frequency, when comparing 2.5-, 5-, and 10-minute frequencies. A possible explanation for this is a trade-off between the effects of microstructure noise and jumps is that higher (lower) sampling frequencies may be associated with more microstructure noise (jumps), which contain less predictable content. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:setup} outlines our setup and modeling assumptions, and includes a brief discussion of some of the realized measures that we construct. Section \ref{sec:drfm} discusses the forecasting framework used, and briefly introduces PCA, SPCA, LASSO and elastic net methods. Section \ref{sec:expset} introduces our experimental setup, and includes a description of our forecasting models and the statistics used to analyze the models. Finally, Section \ref{sec:dat} includes a discussion of the data used in our forecasting experiments, Section \ref{sec:emp} summarizes our key empirical findings. and concluding remarks are contained in Section \ref{sec:conc}. 

\section{Setup}\label{sec:setup}
Consider a $d$-dimensional process, $X$, consisting of $d$ asset log-prices. Following the high-frequency econometrics literature, assume that $X$ follows an It\^{o}-semimartingale defined on the filtered probability space $(\Omega,\mathbb{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \ge 0}, \mathbb{P})$, and has the following representation:\\
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ito}
\begin{split}
X_t = & X_{0}  + \int_{0}^{t} b_s ds + \int_{0}^{t} \sigma_s dW_s \\ &  +  \int_{0}^{t}\int_{\{|x|\le\epsilon\}}x(\mu-\nu)(ds,dx)  +\int_{0}^{t}\int_{\{|x|\ge\epsilon\}}x\mu(ds,dx),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $b_{t}$ and $\sigma_t$ are adapted, c\`{a}dl\`{a}g, and locally bounded. Additionally, $W_t$ is a multidimensional standard Brownian motion, $\mu$ is a random jump measure with compensator $\nu$, and $\epsilon>0$ is an arbitrary threshold. For more details on It\^{o}-semimartingales and continuous-time asset price modeling, see \cite{ait2014high} and the references cited therein.

Various realized measures have been invented to estimate latent volatility on a fixed interval $[0, T]$, using high-frequency intraday data. For instance, realized volatility, one of the most widely known measures, is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rv}
\text{RV}_t = \sum^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor}_{i=1} (\Delta^{n}_{i}X) (\Delta_i^n X^\intercal), \quad \forall t\in[0,T], 
\end{equation}
where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the floor function, $X^\intercal$ denotes the transpose of $X$, and $\Delta^{n}_{i}X = X_{i\Delta_n} - X_{(i-1)\Delta_n}$ is the $i^{th}$ intraday return, with $\Delta_n$ defined as an equally-spaced sampling interval that shrinks to zero. It is well-known that when asset prices are continuous on a fixed interval, $[0, T]$, we have that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rvconv1}
\sum^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor}_{i=1} (\Delta^{n}_{i}X) (\Delta^{n}_{i}X^\intercal)  \overset{\mathbb{P}}\longrightarrow \int_{0}^{t} \sigma_s \sigma_s^\intercal ds, \quad \forall t\in[0,T], 
\end{equation}
as $\Delta_n \to 0$, where $\sigma_{s} \sigma_s^\intercal$ will be referred to as the spot volatility matrix. However, when asset prices are discontinuous on $[0, T]$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rvconv2}
\sum^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor}_{i=1} (\Delta^{n}_{i}X) (\Delta^{n}_{i}X^\intercal)  \overset{\mathbb{P}}\longrightarrow \int_{0}^{t} \sigma_s \sigma_s^\intercal ds + \sum_{0\leq s \leq t} (\Delta X_s) (\Delta X_s^\intercal), \quad \forall t\in[0,T],  
\end{equation}
where the $j$-the element of $\Delta X_s$ is $\Delta X^j_s := X^j_s - X^j_{s-}$, which is non-zero if and only if the $j^{th}$ asset, $X^j$, jumps at time $s$.

To separate integrated volatility from jump variation, one can use the threshold technique developed by \cite{mancini2001disentangling, mancini2009non}, to construct truncated realized volatility (TRV), defined as: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:threshold}
\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor} (\Delta^{n}_{i}X) (\Delta^{n}_{i}X^\intercal) \mathbf{1}_{\{ -c\Delta_n^\varpi \leq \Delta^{n}_{i} X \leq c \Delta_{n}^{\varpi} \}} \overset{\mathbb{P}}\longrightarrow \int_{0}^{t} \sigma_s \sigma_s^\intercal ds,
\end{equation}
for some $\varpi\in(0,1/2)$. The vector of truncation levels $c$ is often set to be a multiplier of the volatility. To determine $c_j$, one can use the multipower variation (MPV) estimator developed by \cite{barndorff2004power} and \cite{barndorff2006limit}, as an initial estimator for the individual volatility. The general formula for the MPV estimator is given by: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:multipower}
\text{MPV}_j(p^+) = \frac{\Delta_n^{1-p^{+}/2}}{m_{p_1}\cdots m_{p_k}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor-k+1} |\Delta_{i}^{n}X^j|^{p_1}\cdots|\Delta_{i+k-1}^{n}X^j|^{p_k} \overset{\mathbb{P}}\longrightarrow  \int_{0}^{t} |\sigma^j_{s}|^{p^{+}} ds,
\end{equation}
with $p_1, p_2,\ldots,p_k\geq0$, $p^{+}$ = $p_1+\cdots+p_k$, and $m_p = \mathbb{E}[|\mathcal{N}(0,1)|^p]$. Then we can set $c_j = a \sqrt{\text{MPV}_j(2) /t}$, with $a=$3, 4, or 5 (these are standard choices in the literature). %One can also combine these two methods and use a truncated multipower variation estimator (see \cite{corsi2010threshold}). As a result, different components of the quadratic variation can be separately analyzed.

We further assume that the continuous part of asset log-prices panel follows a continuous-time factor model on $[0, T]$. Namely, define $Y_t:=X_{0}+\int_{0}^{t} b_s ds+\int_{0}^{t} \sigma_s dW_s$ as the continuous part of $X$, and assume the following factor structure for $Y_t$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:factormod}
Y_t = \Lambda_t F_t + Z_t ,
\end{equation}
where $F_t$ is an $r$-dimensional ($r$ $<$ $d$) unobservable common factor, $Z_t$ is an idiosyncratic component, and $\Lambda_t$ is a $d$$\times$$r$ factor loading matrix, each element of which is adapted and has c\`{a}dl\`{a}g paths almost surely. Here, we specifically call $F_t$ the common price factor, in order to distinguish it from the common volatility factor defined later. The common price factor, $F_t$, and the idiosyncratic component, $Z_t$, are assumed to follow continuous It\^{o}-semimartingales, and are given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:facito}
F_t = F_0 + \int_{0}^{t} h_s ds + \int_{0}^{t} \eta_s dB_s
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:errito}
Z_t = Z_0 + \int_{0}^{t} g_s ds + \int_{0}^{t} \gamma_s d\widetilde{B}_s ,
\end{equation}
where $B_s$ and $\widetilde{B}_s$ are independent Brownian motions. All of the coefficient processes, $h$, $\eta$, $g$ and $\gamma$ are adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \ge 0}$ and have c\`{a}dl\`{a}g paths, almost surely. The above factor model and general settings are also used in \cite{ait2017using}.

\section{Dimension Reduction and Forecasting Methods}\label{sec:drfm}

The HAR model of \cite{corsi2009simple}, upon which we build our analysis, is given as: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:orighar}
\text{RM}_{t+h} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{RM}_{t} + \beta_2 \text{RM}_{[t, t-4]} + \beta_3 \text{RM}_{[t, t-21]} + \epsilon_t ,
\end{equation}
where RM represents a certain realized measure of the integrated volatility (IV) of the target asset, and $\text{RM}_{[t, t-p]}$ is the average of RM's, over the most recent $p+1$ days. For instance, if RV is used as our realized measure in the above HAR model, then we define:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:averv}
\text{RV}_{[t,t-p]} = \frac{1}{p+1}\sum^{p}_{i=0}\text{RV}_{t-i} .
\end{equation}
To eliminate the jump variation from total quadratic variation, we use truncated realized volatility (TRV) in our empirical application, as defined in (\ref{eq:threshold}), noting that TRV is a consistent estimate of IV.\footnote[5]{We actually combine the two estimators in (\ref{eq:threshold}) and (\ref{eq:multipower}), in the following sense. We first use bipower variation to get an initial consistent estimate of IV, and then use this to determine an initial choice for $c$ in (\ref{eq:threshold}). Then, we obtain a second estimate of IV using truncation, and also a second choice of $c$. We iterate this procedure until the estimate of IV converges.} The benchmark HAR model that we examine in our prediction experiments is called HAR-TRV.\footnote[6]{In our forecasting experiments, several more benchmark models are also considered, as outlined in Section \ref{sec:expset}.} This model is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trvhar}
\text{TRV}_{t+h} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{TRV}_{t} + \beta_2 \text{TRV}_{[t, t-4]} + \beta_3 \text{TRV}_{[t, t-21]} + \epsilon_t .
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we examine the following factor-augmented model in our forecasting experiments: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:facaugmod}
y_{t+h} = \beta_0 + \beta_{w}^{\intercal}w_t + \beta_{\Psi}^{\intercal}\Psi_t +  \varepsilon_t ,
\end{equation}
where $y_{t+h}$ denotes $h$-step-ahead daily integrated volatility, $h$ is the forecast horizon (set equal to unity in our experiments), $w_t$ is a vector consisting of truncated realized volatility on day $t$, the weekly average of truncated realized volatility from days $t$-4 to $t$, and the monthly average of truncated realized volatility from days $t$-21 to $t$ (i.e., $w_t$ contains all predictors in the benchmark HAR-TRV model defined in (\ref{eq:trvhar})) and $\Psi_t$ consists of $r$-dimensional unobservable predictors. Based on the structure of factors assumed in (\ref{eq:factormod}) and (\ref{eq:facito}), we define: 
\begin{align*}
\Psi_t := \int_{0}^{t} \text{diag}(\Lambda_s \eta_s \eta_{s}^{\intercal} \Lambda_s^{\intercal}) ds
\end{align*}
and name it the common volatility factor (also called our IV factor in the sequel). Note that one cannot disentangle $\Lambda$ from $\eta$ unless certain identification conditions, such as $\eta\eta^\intercal=I_r$, are imposed. However, as shown above, we don't have to disentangle these components from $\Psi_t$. This is because we are only interested in $\Psi_t$, which is the IV matrix of the $r$ uncorrelated common factors in our setup. In summary, it is worth stressing that unlike many other applications of factor-augmented regression, we do not directly use weighted common factors, $\Lambda_t F_t$, extracted from a large panel of asset returns. Instead, what we actually use as predictors in forecasting models are the estimated IVs of these common factors (i.e. the $\Psi_t$). 

As mentioned above, we propose a two-step shrinkage procedure to estimate the above latent common volatility factors. More specifically, we first use LASSO or elastic net shrinkage on the estimates IVs of all assets in order to obtain a parsimonious group of assets whose IVs are relevant to predicting the target asset's IV. We then apply PCA or SPCA to this group of assets (the panel of asset returns) in order to estimate common asset factors, from which our common IV factors are estimated. These factors are then inputted into (\ref{eq:facaugmod}) in order to forecast IV for the target asset. In the following two sections, we briefly outline the techniques used in this two-step procedure (i.e. the LASSO, elastic net, PCA, and SPCA).

\subsection{LASSO and Elastic Net Shrinkage}\label{subsec:varselec}

In order to select stocks in the first step of our shrinkage procedure, we consider two shrinkage based variable selection, including the LASSO (see \cite{tibshirani1996regression}) and the elastic net (see \cite{zou2005regularization}). Both techniques can be interpreted as regularized or penalized regression methods. Briefly, consider a regression of $y_{t+h}$ on $w_t$ and $\chi_t$, where $y_{t+h}$ and $w_t$ are defined in (\ref{eq:facaugmod}), and $\chi_t$ is a vector of IV estimates on day $t$, for all assets in $X_t$. The LASSO estimator is the solution to the following problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lassomin}
\min_{\phi} ~ \sum_{t}\Bigg\{ \bigg|\bigg| y_{t+h}-\beta^{\intercal}w_t-\sum_j \phi_j\chi_{j,t}\bigg|\bigg|^2 + \lambda \sum_{j} |\phi_j| \Bigg\},
\end{equation}
where the $\phi$'s are regression coefficients in a standard penalized regression. Similarly, the elastic net estimator is a solution to the following problem: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:enmin}
\min_{\phi} ~ \sum_{t}\Bigg\{ \bigg|\bigg| y_{t+h}-\beta^{\intercal}w_t-\sum_j \phi_j\chi_{j,t}\bigg|\bigg|^2 + \lambda \sum_{j} \Big( \frac{(1-\alpha)}{2} \phi^2_{j} + \alpha |\phi_j| \Big)\Bigg\}, 
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \in [0,1]$. Of note is that when $\alpha$ = 1, the elastic net is equivalent to the LASSO. Also, as $\alpha$ shrinks toward 0, elastic net estimators approach those obtained via ridge regression. Furthermore, note that the LASSO imposes an $\mathcal{L}_1$-norm penalty on coefficients in the model, while the elastic net induces a variety of double shrinkage, in the sense that it imposes  $\mathcal{L}_1$-norm and $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm penalties on coefficients in the model. Finally, recall that it is the imposition of the $\mathcal{L}_1$-norm penalty that induces shrinkage to zero of some coefficients in the regression model; and it is the non-zero coefficients in the solution to these minimization problems that are used to select the final set of variables.

In our experiments, we set $\alpha$ = 0.2 and 0.6. Furthermore, the regularization parameter, $\lambda$, is chosen via ten-fold cross validation. Only assets with nonzero $\phi$'s are retained in our final set of selected target predictor assets, say $\widetilde{X}_t$. For two different target assets, the selected pool of assets (i.e. $\widetilde{X}_t$) from which we construct the $\widehat{F}_t$'s and subsequently the $\widehat{\Psi}_t$'s can be substantially different. Intuitively, since the assets in $\widetilde{X}_t$ all have relatively large regression coefficients, they are potentially more informative about the target asset than other assets in $X$. Hence, the common volatility factors extracted using data from this selected pool of assets may be contaminated with less irrelevant information as would have been the case were the entire $X$ dataset used in our analysis.

In closing this section, we stress that the above sorts of shrinkage are (potentially) carried out in both steps of our procedure. In particular, recall that the first step involves shrinkage on the set of all IV estimators of the assets in $X$; and this step is used to select a finer subset of asset returns for further analysis. In the second step, PCA or SPCA is used to construct common factor estimates from the new pared-down asset dataset. These common factor estimates are then used to construct our IV factors. Recall that SPCA can itself be interpreted as a two-step procedure, whereby PCA is first applied, followed by either LASSO or elastic net shrinkage of the PCA factor weights in a second step. Thus, our procedure (potentially) involves two layers of shrinkage, where the first layer involves shrinkage of a large set of IV estimators, and the second layer involves shrinkage of a parsimonious set of assets used to construct a latent common asset return factor (from which our IV factor is extracted). In addition, it is crucial to differentiate between these two layers of shrinkage, in the following sense. The LASSO and elastic net are supervised learning methods, while PCA and SPCA are unsupervised learning methods. Intuitively speaking, the first layer of shrinkage takes the ultimate goal (i.e., forecasting) into account, and carries out shrinkage through deletion of irrelevant variables; while the second layer focuses on the task of dimension reduction through combination of (almost) all variables in the dataset, without focus on forecasting the target variable.

\subsection{(Sparse) Principal Component Analysis}\label{subsec:pca}

In order to carry out the second step of our procedure, we utilize PCA or SPCA, both of which are briefly discussed in this section. To start, consider the following covariance matrix estimator, defined on a fixed interval, $[0, T]$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:varcov}
\widehat{\Sigma}_t = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor}\big\{(\Delta^{n}_{i} X)(\Delta^{n}_{i} X)^{\intercal}\big\}\mathbf{1}_{\{\|\Delta^{n}_{i} X\|\le \boldsymbol{c} \Delta_{n}^{\varpi} \}}, \quad \forall t\in[0,T] .
\end{equation}
One carries out PCA by applying an eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition to $\widehat{\Sigma}_t$, yielding $r$ estimated eigenvalues, in descending order, say $\widehat{\lambda}_1$$>$$\widehat{\lambda}_2$$>$$\cdots$$>$$\widehat{\lambda}_r$, and corresponding estimated eigenvectors, $\widehat{\xi}_1$, $\widehat{\xi}_2$,$\cdots$, $\widehat{\xi}_r$. The first $r$ principal components on the fixed interval are estimated as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:princomp}
	\Delta_{i}^{n}\widehat{F}_{j} = \widehat{\xi}_{j}^\intercal  (\Delta_{i}^{n} X)\mathbf{1}_{\{\|\Delta^{n}_{i} X\|\le \boldsymbol{c} \Delta_{n}^{\varpi} \}}, \quad j=1,\cdots,r.
\end{equation}
With these estimated principal components, latent common volatility factors on day $t$ can subsequently be estimated as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:comvol}
	\widehat{\Psi}_{j,t} = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor t/\Delta_n \rfloor}(\Delta_{i}^{n}\widehat{F}_{j})^2, \quad j=1,\cdots,r.
\end{equation}
Thus, for any $j=1,\cdots,r$, we have $\widehat{\Psi}_{j,t} = \widehat{\xi}_j^\intercal \widehat{\Sigma}_t \widehat{\xi}_j = \widehat{\lambda}_j \widehat{\xi}_j^\intercal \widehat{\xi}_j$, which is equivalent to $\widehat{\lambda}_j$, if the eigenvector has unit-length.

Note that the above PCA procedure delivers the eigens (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of the integrated volatility matrix. According to \cite{ait2018principal}, these eigens are different from the integrated eigens of the spot volatility matrix, when $t$ does not shrink to zero. However, in finite samples, the time horizon $t$, which is one day in our empirical application, is relatively small compared to $\Delta_n$, which we set equal to 2.5-, 5-, and 10-minute in our application. It is unpractical to further split our daily data into further blocks, and hence we do not distinguish eigens of integrated volatility versus integrated eigens of spot volatility differences in our empirical application, following the approach taken by \cite{ait2017using}. 
 
Also, it is well-known that eigens are nonlinear functions of the corresponding covariance matrix. \cite{Jacod&Rosenbaum:2013} show that various bias terms arise when estimating integrals of nonlinear functions of the spot volatility matrix. But when the local window size is relatively small, there is only one bias term, which can be consistently estimated. Moreover, according to \cite{ait2018principal}, these bias terms are proportional to their associated eigens. Consequently, they share the same source of predictive power as eigens. In addition, analogous to our earlier arguments, the ratio $t/\Delta_n$ is small in our empirical application, leading to a bias term that can be treated using the methods of \cite{Jacod&Rosenbaum:2013}. These authors show that the estimator that we use is characterized by a higher order bias term; but nevertheless is consistent. Moreover, the higher order bias, which is an integral over $[0,t]$, is proportional to the true eigenvalue. Hence, in terms of forecasting, there is no distortion of information, since the main source of useful information comes from the eigenvalues. In view of these observations, we don't remove the bias term in our empirical application. 

In general, PCA yields nonzero factor loadings for (almost) all variables, which exacerbates difficulty in interpretation, and can induce noisiness in estimated factors. To avoid these drawbacks, and to induce parsimony, we also utilize SPCA in the second step of our procedure. This technique is closely related to PCA (see \cite{jolliffe2003modified} and \cite{zou2006sparse}), and involves estimating 
``sparse'' eigenvectors $\widehat{\xi}_j$, for $j = 2,3,...,r$, which are solutions to the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spcmax}
\max_{\|\xi_j\|_{2}=1,~ \xi_{j} \perp \xi_1,\cdots,\xi_{j-1}} \xi^{\intercal}_{j}\widehat{\Sigma}_t\xi_j,
\end{equation}
subject to $\sum_{k=1}^{d}|\xi_{j,k}|\le \delta$, where $\delta$ is a regularization parameter.

Note that the constraint in (\ref{eq:spcmax}) imposes an $\mathcal{L}$-1 norm penalty on the  eigenvectors, and hence induces sparsity. As discussed above, \cite{zou2006sparse} introduce other methods for carrying out SPCA based on an alternative interpretation linking SPCA with PCA followed by shrinkage. The key to SPCA, though, is that it yields sparse factor loadings, in the sense that loadings may be identically zero, a feature not feasible in the context of shrinkage on the $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm, such as that associated with ridge regression.\footnote[7]{As in the case of PCA, we use the $r$ largest eigenvectors as common volatility factors in our prediction models.}

\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:expset}
The forecasting model in our IV prediction application is given above as (\ref{eq:facaugmod}). Given that we are interested in predicting TRV, we re-write this model as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forecastmod}
\widehat{\text{TRV}}_{t+1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \widehat{\text{TRV}}_t + \beta_2 \widehat{\text{TRV}}_{[t, t-4]} + \beta_3 \widehat{\text{TRV}}_{[t, t-21]} + \beta_{\Psi}^{\intercal}\widehat{\Psi}_t + \epsilon_t,
\end{equation}
where latent IV factors (i.e., $\widehat{\Psi}_t$), are constructed by implementing the two-step procedure discussed in Section \ref{sec:drfm}.  We choose the number of latent factors, $r$, in our experiments by using an easy-to-implement, albeit $ad~hoc$ rule. First, we sort all eigenvalues in descending order and select (additional) principal components based on their corresponding eigenvalues until their cumulative contribution exceeds (or is equal to) 90\% of the total variation of the dataset. Next, we discard principal components with individual contributions that are less than 5\% of total variation. For instance, if the first 5 principal components contribute 60\%, 10\%, 10\%, 6\%, 4\%, respectively, we keep the first 4 principal components. The idea is very simple and natural. There is a trade-off between a more parsimonious model and a more informative one. Although the choice of cutoffs is somewhat arbitrary, our experimental findings are robust to various other cutoffs.

In total, we examine six factor-augmented models based on six \textquotedblleft permutations\textquotedblright{} of our two-step procedure. These include the following models:

\noindent EN1-PCA: \textit{Step 1: A pool of assets are selected based on elastic net shrinkage (with $\alpha$ = 0.2) of IV dataset. Step 2: Latent integrated volatility factors are extracted from latent asset factors constructed using PCA.}

\noindent EN2-PCA: \textit{Step 1: A pool of assets are selected based on elastic net shrinkage (with $\alpha$ = 0.6) of IV dataset. Step 2: Latent integrated volatility factors are extracted from latent asset factors constructed using PCA.}

\noindent LASSO-PCA: \textit{Step 1: A pool of assets are selected based on LASSO shrinkage of IV dataset. Step 2: Latent integrated volatility factors are extracted from latent asset factors constructed using PCA.}

\noindent EN1-SPCA: \textit{Step 1: A pool of assets are selected based on elastic net shrinkage (with $\alpha$ = 0.2) of IV dataset. Step 2: Latent integrated volatility factors are extracted from latent asset factors constructed using SPCA.}

\noindent EN2-SPCA: \textit{Step 1: A pool of assets are selected based on elastic net shrinkage (with $\alpha$ = 0.6) of IV dataset. Step 2: Latent integrated volatility factors are extracted from latent asset factors constructed using SPCA.}

\noindent LASSO-SPCA: \textit{Step 1: A pool of assets are selected based on LASSO shrinkage of IV dataset. Step 2: Latent integrated volatility factors are extracted from latent asset factors constructed using SPCA.}

Recall also that our main benchmark model, called BM-I is:

\begin{equation}
\widehat{\text{TRV}}_{t+1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \widehat{\text{TRV}}_t + \beta_2 \widehat{\text{TRV}}_{[t, t-4]} + \beta_3 \widehat{\text{TRV}}_{[t, t-21]} + \epsilon_t.
\end{equation}

In addition to BM-I, we evaluate several other benchmark models. First, to demonstrate the importance of the first-step variable selection part of procedure, we construct common volatility factors using only the second step (i.e. PCA or SPCA) and include them in the benchmark BM-I model. This model is denoted BM-II, and is analogous to the widely used ``diffusion index'' model of \cite{bai2006confidence}, \cite{stock2002forecasting}, \cite{stock2002macroeconomic} and \cite{stock2006forecasting}. Second, for cases where we are interested in forecasting IV of sector ETFs, we construct BM-III. This model adds a market volatility predictor measured by the TRV of market ETF (SPY) to BM-I. Third, for cases 
where we are interested in forecasting IV for individual firms, we construct BM-IV and BM-V. In BM-IV,  an additional sector volatility predictor measured by TRV of the sector ETF is added to BM-I. In BM-V,  additional sector and market volatility predictors, constructed as in BM-III and BM-IV, are added to BM-I. These models are utilized in our experiments as follows. When predicting IV for the market ETF (SPY), we compare the performance of our factor augmented models with BM-I and BM-II. When predicting IV for the sector ETFs, we compare the performance of our factor augmented models with BM-I and BM-II, and BM-III. Finally, when predicting IV for individual firms, we compare the performance of our factor augmented models with BM-I and BM-II, BM-III, BM-IV and BM-V.

Model estimation and volatility prediction is carried out each day, using a rolling-window estimation scheme, prior to the construction of each new daily IV prediction. The length of rolling window (i.e. the \textit{in-sample} period), is 630 days (two and a half years). For example, we first estimate all models using data from November 27, 2006 to May 29, 2009 (630 trading days), and then construct one-day-ahead forecasts for June 1, 2009. Then, in order to forecast the volatility on June 2, 2009, we first estimate our models using data from November 28, 2006 to June 1, 2009 (630 trading days). We continue this procedure until we reach the end of our dataset. Finally, we obtain sequences of daily \textit{out-of-sample} volatility forecasts for the sample period from June 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010, which constitutes 402 trading days. Benchmark models are estimated using ordinary least squares. All factor-augmented regressions are estimated using constrained least squares, in order to guarantee that all parameters are nonnegative. By doing so, we avoid any potential negative forecasts of volatility. 

To evaluate the forecasting performance of our factor-augmented and benchmark models, we consider two different criteria: 

(a) \textit{In-sample} $R^2$. 

(b) \textit{Out-of-sample} $R^2$ (\cite{campbell2008predicting}), defined as: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:oosr2}
R^{2} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}(y_t - \widehat{y}_t)^2}{\sum_{t=1}^{T}(y_t - \bar{y}_t)^2} ,
\end{equation}
where $y_t$ is the ex-post value of volatility, $\bar{y}_t$ is the historical average of volatility, and $\widehat{y}_t$ is our forecast. In addition, Diebold-Mariano-West (DMW) predictive accuracy tests of equal predictive accuracy are also carried out and reported. For a detailed discussion of this test, in which the null hypothesis is that two models have equal predictive accuracy, based on a given loss function, see \cite{diebold1995comparing}) and \cite{west1996asymptotic}. In our implementation of the test, we utilized a quadratic loss function. In this sense, we are comparing the MSFEs of two competing models.

\section{Data}\label{sec:dat}
We collect intraday observations on 480 constituents of the S\&P 500 index\footnote[8]{Since the constituents of S\&P 500 index change over time, we only collect those that are always in the index from 2006 to 2010.}; 9 sector ETFs, including: Materials (XLB), Energy (XLE), Financial (XLF), Industrial (XLI), Technology (XLK), Consumer Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU), Health Care (XLV), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY); and the SPDR S\&P 500 ETF (SPY). The sample period is from January 3, 2006 to December 31, 2010. All data are collected from the TAQ database. 

Each individual stock in our dataset is assigned to a sector, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) code system. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:stock-dist}, the largest 4 sectors are Consumer Discretionary (CD), Information Technology (IT), Industrials (I) and Health Care (HC). Approximately 55\% individual stocks in our dataset belong to these four sectors, while the smallest sector, Telecommunication Services (TS), only contains 2.08\% of stocks. 

In our forecasting experiments, target assets include SPY, the 9 sector ETFs listed above, and 18 individual stocks, including: Ecolab Inc. (ECL), Dow Chemical Company (DOW), Chevron Corporation (CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), J.P. Morgan Chase \& Co. (JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), General Electric Company (GE), Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (MMM), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), The Coca-Cola Company (KO), The Procter \& Gamble Company (PG), Duke Energy Corporation (DUK), Southern Company (SO), Johnson \& Johnson (JNJ), Merck \& Company, Inc. (MRK), McDonald's Corporation (MCD), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW).\footnote[9]{Two stocks in this set of 18 individual stocks are from each of the 9 sectors in our dataset. For instance, CVX and XOM belong to the Energy sector, according to the GICS code.} For the sake of brevity, only select results are presented in the sequel. All results are included in a separate appendix. Finally, data cleaning, subsampling, etc., all follow standard procedures described in \cite{ait2012analyzing}; and overnight returns are excluded from our analysis. 

\section{Empirical Findings}\label{sec:emp}

\subsection{Forecasting Performance}\label{subsec:empfin}

We begin by discussing the one-day-ahead predictive performance of the benchmark and various volatility factor-augmented models outlined in Section \ref{sec:expset}, for the forecasting sample period from June 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. In our experiments, we include models with volatility factors constructed using  three different sampling frequencies, including 2.5-, 5-, and 10-minutes. Recall also that all models are estimated with rolling data windows, prior to daily ex ante forecast construction. A number of clear-cut findings emerge upon inspection of the results contained in these Tables \ref{tab:SPY-Pred}--\ref{tab:MCD-Pred}.

The most important finding is that our two-step shrinkage procedure results in notable and significant increases in \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values when predicting daily IV, at firm, sector, and market  levels. In particular, for all assets except for those in the financial sector, increases range from approximately 20\% to 45\%, when compared with $R^2$ values associated with the best performed benchmark models, across all sampling frequencies. Additionally, DMW tests tell us that the volatility factor augmented models yield significantly smaller MSFEs than those of almost all benchmark models. In the following paragraphs, we discuss these (and related) findings in more detail.

Recall that we include five different benchmark models in our experiments. These benchmarks can be described as follows. BM-I is a non-augmented HAR model, BM-II augments BM-I by including an IV factor constructed using only step 2 of our procedure. BM-III and BM-IV include market and sector ETF volatility factors constructed without recourse to our procedure at all. Namely, IV factors are directly constructed from sector and market level asset return data. Finally, BM-V includes the market and sector ETF volatility factors included in BM-III and BM-IV, respectively. Interestingly, the use of BM-II -- BM-V does not always equate with forecasting performance improvement, relative to BM-I. For instance, the \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ of BM-II for the market ETF (SPY) is 0.319 using 5-minute frequency data, which is smaller than than that of BM-I, which is 0.347. As another example, note that for Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) (see Table \ref{tab:DUK-Pred}), BM-III, BM-IV and BM-V generate either negative or approximately zero \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values, using 2.5- or 5-minute frequency data. Indeed, it is only for BM-IV, based on 10-minute frequency data, that we observe a slight increase in forecasting performance, relative to the benchmark HAR-TRV model. In this case there is a 9.8\% improvement in \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ (simply called $R^2$ hereafter). Similar results obtain for XLB, XLI, XLY, GE, and various individual assets. 

Building on the above results, it is important to note that all of our benchmark models are dominated by our two-step IV factor-augmented models. For instance, for XLK (technology), the use of BM-II results in an improvement in $R^2$ from 0.266 to 0.271, when comparing with BM-I (see Table \ref{tab:XLK-Pred}). This is a 1.88\% improvement, and is based on using 5-minute frequency data. However, analogous $R^2$ values based on the use of our factor-augmented models range from 0.271 to 0.292 (corresponding to improvements ranging from 1.88\% to 9.77\%, relative to BM-I). As a second example consider the results in Table 9 for XLV (heath care). While the use of BM-II increases the $R^2$ 0.206 to 0.267 (a 29.6\% improvement, relative to BM-I), our factor-augmented models achieve $R^2$ values ranging from 0.306 to 0.332 (a 48.5\% to 61.2\% improvement, relative to BM-I). Similar patterns emerge when examining results for XLE, XLP, XLU, XLV, CVX, MSFT, KO, and various other individual assets reported on in Tables \ref{tab:SPY-Pred}--\ref{tab:MCD-Pred}. The above findings suggest that it is not enough to simply use market or sector level data in order to directly extract common IV factors. Indeed, if the objective is to maximize predictive content, then there is much to be gained by applying shrinkage methods to disaggregate firm-level data in order to first build a parsimonious set of assets, from which IV factors can be extracted. This is the approach taken in our two-step procedure. Moreover, the more shrinkage the better. For example, recall that the first step of our procedure involves shrinkage applied to the firm level dataset in order to build a parsimonious set of assets, as just described. However, the second step may or may not utilize shrinkage. In particular, when PCA is used in this step, dimension reduction is achieved, but all assets from the first step still play a role, as weights used to construct the IV factor are all non-zero. On the other hand, if SPCA is used (which implies implementing further LASSO or elastic net shrinkage on PCA factor loading weights), then we are implementing a second layer of shrinkage in our procedure, as discussed in the introduction. This approach indeed yields the ``best'' results in our experiments. Consider the case of the energy sector (see Table \ref{tab:XLE-Pred}). For this variable, called XLE, there is an improvement in predictive performance (as measured by $R^2$) if one uses our two-step method with PCA (see results for models EN1-PCA, EN2-PCA, and LASSO-PCA) instead of BM-I - BM-III. However, there is a further predictive improvement if one uses our two-step method with SPCA instead of PCA (see results for models EN1-SPCA, EN2-SPCA, and LASSO-SPCA). Indeed, there are no cases where the $R^2$ does not increase when SPCA is used in our procedure. This finding characterizes all of the results reported in Tables \ref{tab:SPY-Pred}--\ref{tab:MCD-Pred}. 

As a final indicator of the usefulness of the methods discussed in this paper, note that forecasting performance becomes unstable if the first ``variable selection'' step is removed from our procedure. 
For example, again in the case of XLE, although BM-II generates larger $R^2$ values than the benchmark HAR-TRV model using 2.5- and 5-minute frequency data, it performs significantly worse using 10-minute frequency data. In addition, the gains observed even at the 2.5- and 5-minute frequencies are  very small. For example, the $R^2$ for BM-I and BM-II using 5-minute frequency data are very close (0.308 and 0.316, respectively). For individual stocks, the picture is even more stark. For example, in Table \ref{tab:ECL-Pred}, BM-II performs worse than BM-I across all sampling frequencies. The \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ for BM-II is even negative, when 10-minute frequency data are used. In contrast, all our factor-augmented models achieve much higher \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values than both BM-I and BM-II at all sampling frequencies.

There are a number of less important, although still interesting findings that also emerge upon inspection of the results reported in Tables \ref{tab:SPY-Pred}--\ref{tab:MCD-Pred}. 

First, \textit{in-sample} fit is surprisingly stable across different models and the above three different data frequencies, no matter which asset is considered. Namely, \textit{in-sample} fit changes little when common volatility factors are added to the benchmark HAR-TRV model, regardless of asset class. Thus, based solely on \textit{in-sample} diagnostics, there appears to be little gain by adding volatility factors in the original HAR model. In fact, if only \textit{in-sample} $R^2$ values were examined in order to assess the usefulness of common factors, then the story would change markedly. Take Johnson \& Johnson as an example. The benchmark HAR-TRV model using 5-minute frequency data (without a common factor) achieves an \textit{in-sample} $R^2$ value of 0.38, while \textit{in-sample} $R^2$ values for our factor-augmented models are all between 0.42 and 0.43. This small increase associated with utilizing common factors in an \textit{in-sample} context characterizes all of our experiments. Indeed, substantial increases in performance only arise when using latent factors for ex ante prediction. This finding constitutes strong evidence of an important difference between findings based on \textit{in-} and \textit{out-of-sample} experiments.

One way to interpret the above disparity between \textit{in-sample} and \textit{out-of-sample} fit is given as follows. It is widely known that \textit{in-sample} $R^2$ values tend to be substantively greater than out of sample $R^2$ values in financial forecasting applications. This feature has been extensively discussed in the literature, and multiple explanations have been proposed, including the presence of (smooth) structural breaks and state transitions, as well as the general inability of linear models to capture inherently nonlinear interactions among financial variables and markets (see e.g., \cite{paye2006instability}, \cite{aiolfi2009understanding}, and \cite{ang2012regime}). In our experiments, when comparing benchmark HAR models, \textit{in-sample} $R^2$ values are indeed much greater than their \textit{out-of-sample} benchmark HAR counterparts, consistent with the above general finding. For example, using the Coca-Cola Company (see the 5-minute panel in Table \ref{tab:KO-Pred}) to illustrate our findings, the BM-I model achieves an \textit{in-sample} $R^2$ value of 0.56, as opposed to an \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ value of 0.20. However, when the \textquotedblleft best\textquotedblright{} factor-augmented \textit{in-sample} and \textit{out-of-sample} performances are compared in this example, the $R^2$ values are 0.60 and 0.36, respectively. Thus, the relative \textit{out-of-sample} gains associated with utilizing latent volatility factors are greater than the \textit{in-sample} gains. This feature characterizes our results at all market, sector, and individual asset levels, although it is more starkly apparent at the individual stock level.

Second, our \textit{out-of-sample} forecasting results vary with sampling frequency. Moreover, the \textquotedblleft best\textquotedblright{} frequency varies across different assets and asset classes. However, in general, we recommend the use of 5-minute frequency, since our factor-augmented models generally yield the \textquotedblleft best\textquotedblright{} predictions (see below for further discussion) using such data. The rationale for this finding is as follows. On one hand, using a higher frequency may result in contamination with a substantial amount of microstructure noise, which potentially deteriorates predictive performance. On the other hand, if the sampling frequency is relatively low, it is more difficult to eliminate the effects of jumps when estimating latent factors, leading to forecast deterioration (assuming that jumps are usually difficult to predict). 

Third, there is an important wrinkle to the above story. For financial assets, \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values are negative in some cases, and in other cases predictive accuracy gains are negligible. A particularly interesting example of this is the financial sector ETF. For this ETF, simply adding the market ETF volatility to the benchmark HAR-TRV model (i.e. BM-III) results in the best forecasting performance, at 2.5- and 10-minute sampling frequencies (see Table \ref{tab:XLF-Pred}), and at the 5-minute sampling frequency, BM-III also generates higher \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ values than our volatility factor augmented models. At the individual stock level, the picture is even more stark. Consider J.P. Morgan Chase \& Co. (see Table \ref{tab:JPM-Pred}). \textit{Out-of-sample} $R^2$ values for factor-augmented models are always less than 0, when 2.5- and 10-minute frequency data are used, and are less than 0.1 when 5-minute frequency data are used. Furthermore, simply adding both market and financial sector volatilities to the benchmark HAR-TRV model (i.e. BM-V) yields the most accurate forecasts. One possible explanation for the above finding is that the financial sector is a main driving force of the whole market. Hence, a crudely constructed factor is sufficient to capture most of the useful information in the sector. This argument is partly borne out in the data, since the datasets used to construct the volatility factors using our shrinkage methodology, always contain a significant number of financial sector stocks in them; and since these factors in turn lead to the impressive predictive gains when predicting IV, as discussed above. This point is discussed further in Section \ref{subsec:facstruc}.

\subsection{Latent Factor Structures}\label{subsec:facstruc}

Figures \ref{fig:stock-dist}--\ref{fig:select-dist-jnj} and Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-I}--\ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-II} summarize percentages of stocks (by sector) that comprise the variables selected in the first step of our procedure (Figures \ref{fig:stock-dist}--\ref{fig:select-dist-jnj}), and list the key stocks that are utilized in the construction of the latent IV factors in the second step of our procedure (Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-I}--\ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-II}). For the sake of brevity, the above figures and tables only report results for a representative set of target stocks and sectors. Complete results are available upon request. A number of interesting findings based on these figures and tables are summarized below.

We begin by first noting that different variable selection methods (i.e., the LASSO and elastic net) used in the first step of our procedure select almost the same pools of stocks, at each sampling frequency. This is illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:select-dist-spy}--\ref{fig:select-dist-jnj}. In particular, each column of charts in these figures corresponds to results for a particular shrinkage method, while each row contains charts for a particular sampling frequency. Within each chart, absolute as well as relative percentages of stocks chosen in each sector are charted, with relative percentages calculated by rescaling according to the ``size'' of each sector, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:stock-dist}. The stated result can be seen to hold since the three charts in each row of these figures are virtually identical. Thus, there is little to choose between using LASSO or elastic net shrinkage in the first step of our double shrinkage procedure. However, it is worth noting that the pool of selected stocks does change with data frequency (compare each chart in a given column in the figures). For instance, consider the market ETF. Figure \ref{fig:select-dist-spy} indicates that when we use the elastic net with $\alpha$ = 0.2, with 10-minute frequency data, almost 15\% of selected stocks derive from the health care sector. This percentage jumps up to approximately 20\% with 5-minute frequency data. As another example, note that the percentage of information technology stocks drops from approximately 15\% to 10\% when the sampling frequency decreases from 10-minutes to 5-minutes. Similar results can be seen upon inspection of Figures \ref{fig:select-dist-xle} (sector ETF) and \ref{fig:select-dist-jnj} (individual stock). 

Second, note that inspection of the results in Figures \ref{fig:select-dist-spy}--\ref{fig:select-dist-jnj}, suggests that consumer discretionary stocks tend to be selected most frequently, in the first step of our procedure, across all sampling frequencies. This is not surprising, given that the consumer discretionary sector is the largest amongst all sectors (see Figure \ref{fig:stock-dist}). However, when we rescale the number of selected stocks by the size of each sector, then the picture changes. For example, consider the ``Relative Ratio'' results reported in Figure \ref{fig:select-dist-xle}. Here, we see that the relative percentage of financial stocks is greater than the relative percentage of consumer discretionary stocks, at 2 of 3 data frequencies. This indicates the relative importance of financial stocks in the first step of our procedure. 

Third, turning again to Figures \ref{fig:select-dist-spy}--\ref{fig:select-dist-jnj}, note that health care stocks tend to be selected quite frequently in the first step of our procedure. However, relatively small weights are placed on such stocks in the second step, when utilizing PCA and SPCA to estimate our IV factors. For instance, in Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-I}, \ref{tab: XLE-EigVec-I} and \ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-I}, note that very few stocks from the health care sector are contained in our lists of stocks with the highest average factor weights, when averaging across all rolling windows in our prediction experiments.\footnote[10]{Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-I}, \ref{tab: XLE-EigVec-I} and \ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-I} list stocks that received the highest average weights in our IV factors, while Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-II}, \ref{tab: XLE-EigVec-II} and \ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-II} list stocks receiving the lowest average weights.} Furthermore, examination of the results in Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-II}, \ref{tab: XLE-EigVec-II} and \ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-II} indicate that SPCA frequently places identically zero weights on health care stocks, particularly when higher frequency data are used in latent factor construction. For example, in Table \ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-II}, we report the frequency of stocks with a high likelihood of receiving a zero weight, and 7 of 15 listed stocks and 5 of 15 listed stocks belong to the health care sector, at 2.5-and 5-minute data frequencies, respectively. Indeed, almost 64\% and 53\% of daily weights are zero for IDXX (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) and for ILMN (Illumina, Inc.), respectively, under EN1-SPCA, at the 2.5-minute data frequency. Consequently, the average weight on IDXX and on ILMN decreases sharply from 0.068 to 0.021, and from 0.078 to 0.029, respectively, when we change from using PCA to using SPCA in the second step of our procedure. This finding is consistent with our above microstructure noise explanation of the superior performance of models that utilize SPCA, in conjunction with the use of higher frequency data. 

Finally, stocks in the consumer discretionary and financial sectors usually have larger factor loadings (weights), under both PCA and SPCA (see Tables \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-I}, \ref{tab: XLE-EigVec-I} and \ref{tab: JNJ-EigVec-I}), particularly at higher data frequencies. For instance, in Table \ref{tab: SPY-EigVec-I}, only two or three stocks are not in the consumer discretionary and financial sectors, under EN2-PCA/SPCA, using 2.5-minute frequency data. CCL (Carnival Corporation), TGT (Target Corporation) and BBY (Best Buy Co., Inc.) -- in the consumer discretionary sector, and TROW (T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.), AXP (The American Express Company) and PFG (The Principal Financial Group) -- in the financial sector, all have average weights greater than 0.12. Similarly, in Table \ref{tab: XLE-EigVec-I}, these stocks again all have average weights greater than 0.12. Putting all of the above evidence together, we conclude that although health care stocks are frequently chosen in our first step shrinkage procedure, their contributions to common volatility factors appears to be less than that of consumer discretionary and financial stocks.

\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sec:conc}
This paper investigates whether latent common volatility factors extracted from a large-dimensional panel of high-frequency intraday stock returns can improve volatility forecasting. We propose a factor-augmented version of the widely studied HAR model. In our new model, factors are estimated using a two-step procedure involving variable selection using least absolute selection operator (LASSO) or elastic net shrinkage, followed by factor estimation using (sparse) principal components analysis ((S)PCA)). The first step of our procedure involves variable selection based on examination of IV estimators, while the second step involves factor construction using asset returns, followed by IV estimation based on the estimated factor structure.

Our key findings are summarized as follows. First and foremost, we uncover substantial empirical evidence indicating that latent common volatility factors greatly improve the \textit{out-of-sample} predictive accuracy of HAR models, as measured by \textit{out-of-sample} \textit{$R^2$}. Diebold-Mariano-West test results support this finding. Second, our two step procedure ``MSFE-dominates'' a variety of benchmark models where latent factors are constructed using a variety of different methods. Third, \textit{in-sample} model performance is not indicative of \textit{out-of-sample} performance. Indeed, if volatility modeling is viewed solely through the lens of \textit{in-sample} fit, then little is gained by generalizing the HAR model using our procedure. Almost all gains are seen only when true ex ante prediction is carried out. Fourth, we recommend using high frequency datasets consisting of data sampled at 5-minute frequency, when constructing predictions of volatility using IV factor-augmented models. This choice offers a balance between reducing the impact of microstructure noise in higher frequency data, on the one hand, and reducing effects associated with the prevalence of jumps in lower frequency data, on the other hand. We also find that models utilizing SPCA perform better than those with PCA, when these methods are used to extract common volatility factors. This finding points to the usefulness of double shrinkage, given that SPCA can be interpreted as a form of shrinkage applied to PCA, and given that the first stage of our procedure also utilizes shrinkage.

This paper is meant as a starting point, as much remains to be done. For example, although substantial theoretical advances in the application of principal component analysis to high dimensional asset return datasets are made in \cite{ait2017using,ait2018principal}, it remains to ascertain whether the results carry over to the use of SPCA. It also remains to theoretically analyze higher order latent (e.g., volatility) factors that are estimated based using first order latent factors constructed using observed (asset) data. From an empirical perspective, ir remains to further examine the robustness of the findings in this paper to the use of alternative sample periods for both \textit{in-sample} estimation and \textit{out-of-sample} prediction. It also remains to assess whether the findings in this paper can be translated into profitable investment strategies, in real-time trading contexts.

All models other than the benchmark models, denoted as ``BM-I'' and ``BM-II'', include latent volatility factors constructed using our two-step procedure. ``EN1'' and ``EN2'' denote models for which elastic net shrinkage is used in initial variable selection, with $\alpha$ = 0.2 and 0.6, respectively. ``LASSO'' denotes the use of the least absolute shrinkage operator in initial variable selection. After the initial variable selection, either PCA or SPCA is utilized to obtain the latent volatility factor(s) used in all models (other than BM-I and BM-II). Entries in parentheses under each \textit{out-of-sample} $R^2$ statistic are $t$-statistics from Diebold-Mariano-West (DMW) tests of equal predictive accuracy. The are two different tests carried out for each model, corresponding to the case where either BM-I (upper bracketed statistic) or BM-II (lower bracketed statistic) is used as the null model, against which the model listed in the first row of entries in the table is compared. The loss function used in the tests is the mean square forecast error, and ***, ** and * indicate rejection at 1\%, 5\% and 10\% significance levels, respectively. Finally, positive statistic values indicate that the MSFE of the benchmark model is higher, so that rejection of the null hypothesis in this case implies that the IV factor model outperforms the benchmark. Complete details are given in Sections \ref{sec:drfm} and \ref{sec:emp}.

	\item \textsuperscript{*}Note: Numerical entries in the columns denoted by ``PCA'' and ``SPCA'' indicate the sample averages of the factor loadings (weights) assigned to each stock in the construction of the principal component in the second step of our latent IV factor estimation procedure, based on these two alternative factor estimation methods. Stocks listed in the table are the most frequently chosen ones in the first step (variable selection) in our procedure, for the target asset given in the title of the table. In each sampling frequency panel, only stocks with the fifteen largest average factor loadings are included, in descending order, in the interests of space. Finally, averaging is done across all rolling windows in our prediction experiments. For complete details, refer to Sections \ref{sec:drfm} and \ref{sec:emp}.

	\item \textsuperscript{*}Note: See notes to Table 20. In this table, rather than tabulating 
	sample averages of the factor loadings (weights) assigned to each stock that are the most frequently chosen, tabulated entries correspond to sample averages of factor loading associated with stocks that are the least frequently selected, as indicated by the percentage of times that SPCA assigns identically zero weights to them. This percentage is called ``Zero Rate'' in the table, and results are reported for stocks with the fifteen largest average ``zero rates'', in descending order.

		\item \textsuperscript{*}Notes: Following the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) coding system, 480 constituents of the S\&P 500 index in our dataset are classified into 11 sectors. The percentage of each sector is reported in this figure. The 11 sectors are materials (M), energy (E), real estate (RE), utilities (U), telecommunication services (TS), information technology (IT), financials (F), health care (HC), consumer staples (CS), consumer discretionary (CD), and Industrials (I).

	   \item \textsuperscript{*}Notes: Charts in this figure indicate the percentages of stocks in each sector that are selected in the first step of our procedure using either the elastic net (first two columns of charts) or the LASSO (third column of charts), for the target asset given in the title of the figure. More specifically, for each rolling window, we calculate the ratio of the number of selected stocks in each sector to the total number of selected stocks, and take the average over all rolling windows in our out-of-sample prediction period. This is denoted ``Absolute Ratio''. We also chart the ``Relative Ratio'', for which the average ratios in ``Absolute Ratio'' are rescaled by the size of each sector, as given in \ref{fig:stock-dist}. Finally, the different sectors are denoted along the horizontal axis of each chart. See Sections 3 and 4 for further details.
