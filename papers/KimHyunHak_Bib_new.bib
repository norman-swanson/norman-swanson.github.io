  journal = {Journal of the American Statistical Association},
  year = {1999},
  volume = {94},
  pages = {446--455},
  abstract = {We discuss a technique that provides prediction intervals based on
	a model called an empirical linear model. The technique, high-dimensional
	empirical linear prediction (HELP), involves principal component
	analysis, factor analysis and model selection. In fact, a special
	case of the empirical model is the factor analysis model. A factor
	analysis model does not generally aim at prediction, however. Therefore,
	HELP can be viewed as a technique that provides prediction (and confidence)
	intervals based on a factor analysis model or a more generalized
	model, possibly with unknown dimension to be estimated. Although
	factor analysis models do not typically have justifiable theory due
	to nonidentifiability, we show that our intervals are justifiable
	asymptotically. An interval for a future response is called a prediction
	interval; an interval for the mean of the future response is called
	a confidence interval. These intervals were compared to the intervals
	of Hwang and Liu, which were derived using standard asymptotic theory
	where the relevant covariance matrix has a fixed dimension. In contrast,
	our intervals are derived asymptotically with the dimension of the
	covariance matrix approaching infinity, a result much more difficult
	to obtain. However, the numerical results show that the intervals
	of this article are much more satisfactory in many cases, including
	the motivating application. The application that motivated us arises
	from the work of a group of electrical engineers led by Souders and
	Stenbakken at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
	(NIST). Their aim is to reduce the number of measurements of a high-dimensional
	variable of dimension, 213 = 8,192, called the future "measurements,"
	by using the past measurements of similar electric components, such
	as A/D converters. They claim that only 64 out of 8,192 measurements
	need to be measured to predict the rest of unobserved measurements
	well. In this article, we construct our intervals using only 64 measurements
	of the "future observations" and show that the intervals seem narrow
	enough to justify their claim.},

  abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of
	numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space.
	A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent
	minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed
	for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific
	algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation,
	and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic
	likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for
	the particular case where the individual additive components are
	regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models
	are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive,
	highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification,
	especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections
	between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire
	and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

  edition = {2nd},
  abstract = {{During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
	and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
	in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
	The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
	of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
	as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these
	tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
	terminology. This book descibes theimprtant ideas in these areas
	ina common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical,
	the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
	are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a vluable
	resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in
	science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised
	learing (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
	neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
	boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any
	book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
	of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
	in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
	models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
	of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
	curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
	of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
	is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
	and projection pursuit.}},

  abstract = {This paper compares the mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) and mixed-frequency
	VAR (MF-VAR) approaches to model specification in the presence of
	mixed-frequency data, e.g., monthly and quarterly series. MIDAS leads
	to parsimonious models based on exponential lag polynomials for the
	coefficients, whereas MF-VAR does not restrict the dynamics and therefore
	can suffer from the curse of dimensionality. But if the restrictions
	imposed by MIDAS are too stringent, the MF-VAR can perform better.
	Hence, it is difficult to rank MIDAS and MF-VAR a priori, and their
	relative ranking is better evaluated empirically. In this paper,
	we compare their performance in a relevant case for policy making,
	i.e., nowcasting and forecasting quarterly GDP growth in the euro
	area, on a monthly basis and using a set of 20 monthly indicators.
	It turns out that the two approaches are more complementary than
	substitutes, since MF-VAR tends to perform better for longer horizons,
	whereas MIDAS for shorter horizons.},
